                Travel provides professional tour planning for artists at DIY rates. We are an IATA-accredited
                travel agency, so we are able to earn commissions directly from travel vendors. Other tour
                planning services may charge you a commission or fee on top of the rate you pay for your travel
                expenses. Our tour planning always comes with a comparison of our rates versus those of
                leading discount travel providers, making sure that there are no hidden fees or charges. We are
                confident in comparing our rates with anyone else’s.</p>
